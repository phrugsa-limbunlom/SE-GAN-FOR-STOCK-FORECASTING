## SE-GAN: Sentiment-Enhanced GAN for Stock Price Forecasting
### A Comprehensive Analysis of Short-Term Prediction

Conducted sentiment analysis on Microsoft headlines using the FINBERT model (pre-trained NLP model) from Hugging Face and integrating the sentiment scores with the Microsoft stock data to train the Generative Adversarial Networks model (GANs) for predicting daily closing prices of Microsoft Stock. 

The results show that the proposed SE-GAN model can achieve lower RMSE scores than other baseline models like LSTM and GRU. Also, the predicted prices yield promising results, achieving over 69% accuracy for forecasting price change.
